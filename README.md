# CMPM 121 D3 Project

This D3 project uses a map-based game using "Leaflet". The player can look around the grid cells closest to them and collect tokens generated and find that different cells have different values.

## Gameplay

- Click nearby cells (within 3 tiles) to pick up or combine tokens.
- Players can only hold one token at a time.
- Combine two tokens of the same value to create a new token worth double.
